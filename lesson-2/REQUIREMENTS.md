# Make sure you have installed and working

- Docker and Docker Compose - https://www.docker.com/
- NodeJs - https://nodejs.org

For NodeJS it's recommended to use something like [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm-widows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

Also for windows it is generally better if you cna use WSL ( windows subsystem for Linux if possible).
